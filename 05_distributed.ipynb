    "As we have seen so far, Dask allows you to simply construct graphs of tasks with dependencies, as well as have graphs created automatically for you using functional, Numpy or Pandas syntax on data collections. None of this would be very useful, if there weren't also a way to execute these graphs, in a parallel and memory-aware way. So far we have been calling `thing.compute()` or `dask.compute(thing)` without worrying what this entails. Now we will discuss the options available for that execution, and in particular, the distributed scheduler, which comes with additional functionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "- How much speedup is possible for this task (hint, look at the graph).\n",
    "- Given how many cores are on this machine, how much faster could the parallel schedulers be than the single-threaded scheduler.\n",
    "- How much faster was using threads over a single thread? Why does this differ from the optimal speedup?\n",
    "- Why is the multiprocessing scheduler so much slower here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threaded` scheduler is a fine choice for working with large datasets out-of-core on a single machine, as long as the functions being used release the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) most of the time. NumPy and pandas release the GIL in most places, so the `threaded` scheduler is the default for `dask.array` and `dask.dataframe`. The distributed scheduler, perhaps with `processes=False`, will also work well for these workloads on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For workloads that do hold the GIL, as is common with `dask.bag` and custom code wrapped with `dask.delayed`, we recommend using the distributed scheduler, even on a single machine. Generally speaking, it's more intelligent and provides better diagnostics than the `processes` scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/scheduling.html provides some additional details on choosing a scheduler.\n",
