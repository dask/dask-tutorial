    "As we have seen so far, Dask allows you to simply construct graphs of tasks with dependencies, as well as have graphs created automatically for you using functional, Numpy or Pandas syntax on data collections. None of this would be very useful, if there weren't also a way to execute these graphs, in a parallel and memory-aware way. So far we have been calling `thing.compute()` or `dask.compute(thing)` without worrying what this entails. Now we will discuss the options available for that execution, and in particular, the distributed scheduler, which comes with additional functionality.\n",

You should start your reading [here](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#architecture), and in particular note that the distributed scheduler was a complete rewrite with more intelligence around sharing of intermediate results and which tasks run on which worker. This will result in better performance in *some* cases, but still larger latency and overhead compared to the threaded scheduler, so there will be rare cases where it performs worse. Fortunately, the dashboard now gives us a lot more [diagnostic information](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diagnosing-performance.html#diagnosing-performance).
