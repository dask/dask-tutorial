    "\n",
    "- How much speedup is possible for this task (hint, look at the graph).\n",
    "- Given how many cores are on this machine, how much faster could the parallel schedulers be than the single-threaded scheduler.\n",
    "- How much faster was using threads over a single thread? Why does this differ from the optimal speedup?\n",
    "- Why is the multiprocessing scheduler so much slower here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threaded` scheduler is a fine choice for working with large datasets out-of-core on a single machine, as long as the functions being used release the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) most of the time. NumPy and pandas release the GIL in most places, so the `threaded` scheduler is the default for `dask.array` and `dask.dataframe`. The distributed scheduler, perhaps with `processes=False`, will also work well for these workloads on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For workloads that do hold the GIL, as is common with `dask.bag` and custom code wrapped with `dask.delayed`, we recommend using the distributed scheduler, even on a single machine. Generally speaking, it's more intelligent and provides better diagnostics than the `processes` scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/scheduling.html provides some additional details on choosing a scheduler.\n",
