    "Whereas there is a wealth of information in the documentation, linked above, here we aim to give practical advice to aid your understanding and application of Dask in everyday situations. This means that you should not expect every feature of Dask to be covered, but the examples hopefully are similar to the kinds of work-flows that you have in mind.\n",

    "The layout of the tutorial will be as follows:\n",
    "- Foundations: an explanation of what Dask is, how it works, and how to use lower-level primitives to set up computations. Casual users may wish to skip this section, although we consider it useful knowledge for all users.\n",
    "- Distributed: information on running Dask on the distributed scheduler, which enables scale-up to distributed settings and enhanced monitoring of task operations. The distributed scheduler is now generally the recommended engine for executing task work, even on single workstations or laptops.\n",
    "- Collections: convenient abstractions giving a familiar feel to big data\n",
    "    - bag: Python iterators with a functional paradigm, such as found in func/iter-tools and toolz - generalize lists/generators to big data; this will seem very familiar to users of PySpark's [RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD)\n",
