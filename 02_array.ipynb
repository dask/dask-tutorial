    "\n",
    "If your chunks are too small, the amount of actual work done by every task is very tiny, and the overhead of coordinating all these tasks results in a very inefficient process. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the dask scheduler takes approximately one millisecond to coordinate a single task. That means we want the computation time to be comparatively large, i.e in the order of seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitive analogy by Genevieve Buckley:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lets imagine we are building a house. It is a pretty big job, and if there were only one worker it would take much too long to build. So we have a team of workers and a site foreman. The site foreman is equivalent to the Dask scheduler: their job is to tell the workers what tasks they need to do.  \n",
    "Say we have a big pile of bricks to build a wall, sitting in the corner of the building site. If the foreman (the Dask scheduler) tells workers to go and fetch a single brick at a time, then bring each one to where the wall is being built, you can see how this is going to be very slow and inefficient! The workers are spending most of their time moving between the wall and the pile of bricks. Much less time is going towards doing the actual work of mortaring bricks onto the wall.  \n",
    "Instead, we can do this in a smarter way. The foreman (Dask scheduler) can tell the workers to go and bring one full wheelbarrow load of bricks back each time. Now workers are spending much less time moving between the wall and the pile of bricks, and the wall will be finished much quicker. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Too big is a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "If your chunks are too big, this is also a problem because you will likely run out of memory. You will start seeing in the dashboard that data is being spill to disk and this will lead to performance decrements. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we load to much data into memory, Dask workers will start to spill data to disk to avoid crashing. Spilling data to disk will slow things down significantly, because of all the extra read and write operations to disk. This is definitely a situation that we want to avoid, to watch out for this you can look at the worker memory plot on the dashboard. Orange bars are a warning you are close to the limit, and gray means data is being spilled to disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "To watch out for this, look at the worker memory plot on the Dask dashboard. Orange bars are a warning you are close to the limit, and gray means data is being spilled to disk - not good! For more tips, see the section on using the Dask dashboard below. To learn more about the memory plot, check the [dashboard documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dashboard.html#bytes-stored-and-bytes-per-worker).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Rules of thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users have reported that chunk sizes smaller than 1MB tend to be bad. In general, a chunk size between **100MB and 1GB is good**, while going over 1 or 2GB means you have a really big dataset and/or a lot of memory available per worker.\n",
    "- Upper bound: Avoid very large task graphs. More than 10,000 or 100,000 chunks may start to perform poorly.\n",
    "- Lower bound: To get the advantage of parallelization, you need the number of chunks to at least equal the number of worker cores available (or better, the number of worker cores times 2). Otherwise, some workers will stay idle.\n",
    "- The time taken to compute each task should be much larger than the time needed to schedule the task. The Dask scheduler takes roughly 1 millisecond to coordinate a single task, so a good task computation time would be in the order of seconds (not milliseconds).\n",
    "- Chunks should be aligned with array storage on disk. Modern NDArray storage formats (HDF5, NetCDF, TIFF, Zarr) allow arrays to be stored in chunks so that the blocks of data can be pulled efficiently. However, data stores often chunk more finely than is ideal for Dask array, so it is common to choose a chunking that is a multiple of your storage chunk size, otherwise you might incur high overhead. For example,  if you are loading data that is chunked in blocks of (100, 100), the  you might might choose a chunking strategy more like (1000, 2000) that is larger but still divisible by (100, 100). \n",
