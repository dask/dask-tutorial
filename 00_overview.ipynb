    "\n",
    "Each section is a Jupyter notebook. There's a mixture of text, code, and exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't used Jupyterlab, it's similar to the Jupyter Notebook. If you haven't used the Notebook, the quick intro is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are two modes: command and edit\n",
    "2. From command mode, press `Enter` to edit a cell (like this markdown cell)\n",
    "3. From edit mode, press `Esc` to change to command mode\n",
    "4. Press `shift+enter` to execute a cell and move to the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolbar has commands for executing, converting, and creating cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of the tutorial will be as follows:\n",
    "- Foundations: an explanation of what Dask is, how it works, and how to use lower-level primitives to set up computations. Casual users may wish to skip this section, although we consider it useful knowledge for all users.\n",
    "- Distributed: information on running Dask on the distributed scheduler, which enables scale-up to distributed settings and enhanced monitoring of task operations. The distributed scheduler is now generally the recommended engine for executing task work, even on single workstations or laptops.\n",
    "- Collections: convenient abstractions giving a familiar feel to big data\n",
    "    - bag: Python iterators with a functional paradigm, such as found in func/iter-tools and toolz - generalize lists/generators to big data; this will seem very familiar to users of PySpark's [RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD)\n",
    "    - array: massive multi-dimensional numerical data, with Numpy functionality\n",
    "    - dataframes: massive tabular data, with Pandas functionality\n",
    "    \n",
    "Whereas there is a wealth of information in the documentation, linked above, here we aim to give practical advice to aid your understanding and application of Dask in everyday situations. This means that you should not expect every feature of Dask to be covered, but the examples hopefully are similar to the kinds of work-flows that you have in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: Print `Hello, world!`\n",
    "Each notebook will have exercises for you to solve. You'll be given a blank or partially completed cell, followed by a hidden cell with a solution. For example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the text \"Hello, world!\"."
